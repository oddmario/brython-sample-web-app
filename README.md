## Required modules
```
pip install brython
pip install Flask
pip install gevent
```

## Notes
- The `brython.js`, `brython_stdlib.js` and `unicode.txt` files in `web/views` were first generated by executing `brython-cli --install` as explained in the **Local installation** section of https://brython.info/static_doc/en/install.html
- The `brython_modules.js` file is generated by `app.py` on each run by executing `brython-cli --modules`, then it's copied to `web/static/js` along with the other Brython JS files and `unicode.txt`
